optimization tips:

good script organization -

imports
constants/globals
functions
classes
main





only opening once:


FILES = ['a.txt', 'b.txt']
fileDict = {}
for f in FILES:
  fileDict[f] = open(f, 'w')

fileDict[f].write('Hi')
fileDict['a.txt'].write('Hi2')

MY_FILE = 'go_fast.txt'

def write_it(i, f):
  f.write(str(i))

with open(MY_FILE, 'a') as f:
  for i in range(0, 100000)
    write_it(i, f)









# Open files here

for f in FILES:
  filesDict[f] = open(f, 'w')

# Big for loop going through all reads

for i in range(0,100000)
  fileDict[f].write('Hi' + str(i))

# Close files here

for f in FILES:
  fileDict[f].close()
